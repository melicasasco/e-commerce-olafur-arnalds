        "description": "some kind of peace is a journey of Ólafur's personal and creative growth, set against the backdrop of a chaotic world. You'll hear hints of those private experiences - sometimes even samples of the significant events themselves – woven into an album that is remarkable in its openness, and its beauty. Throughout Ólafur urges you to embrace all that life throws at you, and above all to react, and contemplate, to find your kind of peace."
